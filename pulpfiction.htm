          <p>After the success of "Reservoir Dogs" and "Jackie Brown," Quinten Tarantino and Miramax raised the stakes even higher. With returning and new stars alike, Tarentino managed to string together unlikely heroes and villians in a stark and surprising world of crime, drama, romance, and comedy. The result was "Pulp Fiction."</p>

          <p>Undoubtedly however is the likelyhood of cut or altered scenes, as well as obscure trivia. Below are some facts and trivia you may or may not have been aware of one of the most notorious films of the 90s.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>"Jack Rabbit Slims," the restaurant Mia and Vincent go to, was not a set but an actual restaurant in Hawthorne, California. Sadly, it was demonislihed soon after filming.</li>

            <li>Vincent Vega's red 1964 Chevelle in the film actually belonged to Quentin Tarantino. After filming, the vehicle was stolen. Disappearing for years, it turned up after being stripped in 2013 with an altered VIN with the current owner unaware it being stolen.</li>

            <li>The bandage on the back of Marcellus Wallace wasn't purposeful character design. The actor simply had cut himself while shaving and when framing the shot, Tarantino decided to keep it in as it gave visual interest in the frame as he spoke with Bruce Willis.</li>

            <li>Speaking of Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel was the one who originally convinced Bruce to take part as he was a huge fan of "Reservoir Dogs."</li>

            <li>The <b>F-Bomb</b> was used in the film two hundred and sixty-five times according to IMDB.</li>

            <li>You can faintly hear Jules and Vincent talking during the opening scene with the restaurant robbers.</li>

            <li>The Wolf was a character completely designed around and for Harvey Keitel.</li>

            <li>The briefcase contains "Whatever the viewer wants it to be" according to Tarantino himself. Popular speculations are that it is the case of diamons from "Reservior Dogs" or Marcellus Wallace's soul, but these myths are as valid as they are invalid!</li>
          </ul>
